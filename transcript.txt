 So, let's start our meeting. I am the product manager, Neha. Hello team, thanks for joining on short notice. We need to finalize the release plan for the save for later feature. First, can we confirm that development is fully complete? Please Rohan tell us. Yes ma'am. All core functionalities have been implemented. Users can now add items to save for later list from both the carton product pages. The data sends in real time with the user's profile. Excellent. Any known issues or edge cases still pending? There is one minor bug where the save for list doesn't refresh instantly if accessed from the home page. It's a UI states issue should be fixable today. Okay ma'am, myself Shruti. We have completed most of the test cases. Three out of 25 test cases failed, but they are all related to the same refresh bug Rohan mentioned. Otherwise, the flow is stable across devices. All right. So, assuming the fix goes in today, we can move forward with rollout tomorrow. Shruti, are we clear to do final regression testing after the patch? Yes. I have research time tomorrow morning just for that. Perfect. Let's aim for a soft launch by Thursday. Maybe push it to 10% of users initially. Also please update the documentation of consulance before it is fully loaded. Sure ma'am. I will also send the new API details to the mobile team. They might need to sync bookmarks across the platform. Ma'am, one last thing. The browser back button occasionally skips the save for later page in Firefox. Not a blogger, but we should log it for post real fixes. Hmm. Noted. Thanks for catching that. Okay. That wraps up the update. Let's regroup on Friday for post launch feedback.
